## Teaching Experience

### **CSE 337 / ISE 337 â€“ Scripting Languages**  
**Semester:** Spring 2023  
**Instructor:** Dr. Christopher Kane

As a teaching assistant, I supported instruction for the undergraduate course *Scripting Languages*, which introduces the fundamentals of scripting for rapid development, automation, and application composition.

I contributed to lectures and student guidance on:

- **Python fundamentals** including functions, data structures, and object-oriented programming  
- **Regular expressions** for powerful text processing  
- **Shell scripting** on Linux and Windows platforms  
- **Web scraping, GUI scripting, and server-side scripting** in Python
