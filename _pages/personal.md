## Hi, I'm Jyotiprakash 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer who loves **building scalable systems**, exploring **distributed computing**, and solving complex technical problems.

Beyond coding, I enjoy getting outdoors—**hiking scenic trails**, experiencing new places, and challenging myself physically and mentally.

### 💻 What I enjoy:
- Building robust backend architectures and solving real-world problems  
- Exploring system design, networking, and cloud infrastructure  
- Competitive programming and algorithmic problem solving  
- Teaching and mentoring others in programming and tech  
- Automating workflows and experimenting with dev tools  

### 🏔 Outside of work:
- Long hikes and nature trails  
- Exploring new tech communities and meetups  
- Capturing scenic photos and planning weekend adventures  

### 🧠 Problem Solving:
I actively solve problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Zenitsu68/) and constantly challenge myself to improve my skills.
